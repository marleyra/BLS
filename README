Repo for my work with Bureau of Labor Statistics QCEW surveys.
Written to work with data within the unzipped raw BLS data downloaded from https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm, years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020.
Utilizes Metro/Micropolitan County designations from the US Census (created with OMB and used by BLS) and the BEA (which features combination areas not present in the Census).
Regional designations from Wikipedia(?)
